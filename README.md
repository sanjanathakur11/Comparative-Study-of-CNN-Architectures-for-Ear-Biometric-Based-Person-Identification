**Deep Learning for Ear Biometric Recognition Using Transfer Learning**

This project focuses on building a robust ear biometric recognition system using transfer learning with state-of-the-art deep learning models. We leveraged pre-trained architectures such as EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG19 to classify ear images with high accuracy and reliability.

Through fine-tuning on our specialized dataset, the models achieved outstanding performance:

DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB0: 100% accuracy

ResNet50: 99.39% accuracy

VGG19: 99.24% accuracy

MobileNetV2: 98.49% accuracy

We performed comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs to optimize the models' efficiency and generalization capabilities. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate each modelâ€™s performance, strengths, and trade-offs.

This research underscores the potential of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in biometric identification, demonstrating how transfer learning enhances recognition accuracy even with domain-specific data. Additionally, the study provides valuable insights into model selection and optimization techniques for developing advanced biometric systems.

For confidentiality reasons, the trained models are currently secured in a password-protected archive. We will release access or update the password once our conference paper is officially published.
